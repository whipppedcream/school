People can become affluent in hunter-gatherer societies because there is equal supply and demand. However, there are classes in agricultural societies, making supply not equal to demand.

### Summary 

**Jared Diamond**  
- "Acriculture is the worst mistake of humankind"
- We eat less variety of food, thus people are shorter
- more diseases
- have social hierachy
- We don't want to change but we **have to** change from **quality to quantity**.

**Harari (Sapiens)**
- "Agriculture happenned by accident"
- It can't be stop because of the population growth


**Andrew Mars**
- Starting with climate change --> food is harder to find + people are lazy --> settlement and grow crops
- All the bad things and reasons are stated like Jared and Harari.
