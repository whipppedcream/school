### Why World History?
World history helps us similarities between cultures which are not thought to be some country's cultures (eg. Thai "waii" in India). World history makes us see different views of something we once thought as similar (eg. Buddhism in other countries).  
Take for the example the list of presidents of the Republic of Korea and Thailand. Most of the presidents and prime ministers of Thailand and Korea from 1945 and 1980 are very similar, and backed by the US to support democracy. World history helps account this explanation. It helps account the similarities and differences in the world events.

### When should history begin?
Why should we focus only on humans when the world has begun long ago? Observe that the division of history in different periods and eras will define what we need to study about the history. (Take, for example, Max's autobiography by division into different eras (primary/secondary), (early/middle/late), (before/after heartbreak)).
