## Cognitive Revolution

**Tools as Problem Solving**

Tools make us know that there are problems at that time. For example, the lack of food led to the creation of weapons. People at that time recognized that there were problems, and they needed a way to solve problems. Development is when we recognize and try to solve the problem.

**Control of Fire**

Fire brought many benefits, not only warmth and light. It changed the way humans ate to a healthier and more diverse diet. A study showed that changing to eat cooked food led to increased food quality and range. This made humans take lower energy to digest the food. More nutrients and energy are given to the brain - an increase in brain size. 

**Red Dots Panel**

*Note*: The preceding are events in paleolithic era. 

**Women's Arts**

People recognize the importance of art. People studied handprints in three different sites. They determined that three-quarters of the handprints were of female. (At that time the body differences between men and women were large.)

**Bear-Human**

An example of intangible things which humans thought of at that time and the creation of common belief. An example of belief in intangible things in the present is money. Once everyone in the society believes that a stupid paper has some monetary value, the money system exists. For example, the Khmer Rouge who made someone's bank notes useless. A benefit is of common belief in intangible things is that people can agree and cooperate into one thing. 

**Mastodon Skeleton**

Some time in the past people wondered if it was the skeleton of an elephant. **George Cuvier** argued that it was the skeleton of an extinct animal. If the characteristics of the skeletons do not match the present-day animal, the animal must live in another world *previous to ours* and destroyed by *some kind of catastrophe*. He also disagreed with evolution, but organisms have organs in order to perform a specific function by themselves. At that time, people disagreed with him and believed that no previous world existed. The Christians, however, supported this argument due to the relation of *catastrophe* and *Noah's arc*. 

**Mass Extinction** 

Some time later, *catastrophe* changed. It was the change in human ways of lives, especially in agriculture. Agriculture led to the decrease in forest areas. This led to an important question: are humans the ผู้กำเนิดอารยธรรมอัน**ยิ่งใหญ่**ให้กับโลก? However, people agreed on one thing: the Paleolithic society was the *Original Affluent Society*. At that time, people can find what they needed. (Demands can always be fulfilled.) . If that was really the case, then why did it change into an agricultural society?

**Assignment**

Make 4 groups. Make a 15-minute presentation to introduce your tour showing how the river and human civilization interreact and why we should buy your tour

Group 1: Tigris-Euphrates, Group 2: Nile, Group 3: Indus and Ganges, Group 4: Yellow and Yangtze

Next week:

Group 1 and 2: present the trip next week

Group 3 and 4: write an MS Sway blog on "Agricultural Revolution: Treat or Threat?" to compare ideas of three authors. (At least 5 paragraphs). Send 2 weeks before class.
