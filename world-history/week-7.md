### The Vedas

- sruti (heard), not remembered
- Humans are divided into classes from body parts of the god
  - Brahmins (priests) come from the mouth.
  - Kshatriyas (rulers) come from the arms
  - Vaishyas (peasants) come from the legs
  - Shudras (laborers) come from the feet.

### Bhavat Gita

A piece of spin-off from Mahabharata. Talked about caste and a person's responsibility. 

### Ancient Chinese

Even though the Yellow River is important to the lives of the people, the river has flooded about 1600 times in 2500 years. 

Most of the conflicts happen internally.

China is not an empire in the present. Modern China starts from the Yuan Dynasty.

Xia Dynasty: no proof, but heard

Shang and Zhou Dynasty: shaped the thinking of the Chinese, for example being kings; oracle bones with ancient letters and alphabets which can forecast the future, on every bone the name of a god "Shangdi" is written.

Zhou Dynasty: new ideas replacing Shangdi: Mandate of Heaven. A dynasty being strong implies support from the heaven. If heaven does not support, the dynasty will crumble. Three factors: cheating, disaster, uprising. Confucianism (benevolence, ritual/norm, righteousness)

### Rivers

Thoughts about rivers vary from one civilization to another. 

Mesopotemia: many city-states

Egypt: centralized power

Indus: Grid system, centralized power

Huang He: internally cut then internal conflicts occur
