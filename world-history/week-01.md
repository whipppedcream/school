### Why World History?
World history helps us similarities between cultures which are not thought to be some country's cultures (eg. Thai "waii" in India). World history makes us see different views of something we once thought as similar (eg. Buddhism in other countries).  
Take for the example the list of presidents of the Republic of Korea and Thailand. Most of the presidents and prime ministers of Thailand and Korea from 1945 and 1980 are very similar, and backed by the US to support democracy. World history helps account this explanation. It helps account the similarities and differences in the world events.

### When should history begin?
Why should we focus only on humans when the world has begun long ago? Observe that the division of history in different periods and eras will define what we need to study about the history. (Take, for example, Max's autobiography by division into different eras (primary/secondary), (early/middle/late), (before/after heartbreak)).

> The author is Ernst Gombirch, an Austrian-born art historian, who is well known for many works of cultural and art history. He argued that history begins during the time where we have a very precise idea of what had happened and when it happened, and that during the beginning of history people already had things that modern people had, such as cows, sheeps, dogs, etc. The author pinpoints the beginning of history to 3100 BC in Egypt. This is probably because it was one of the earliest civilizations where we had exact and clear records of what had happened in the past in the forms of hymns and landmarks such as the pyramids.

### Summary (sorry for any mistake)  
**Carl Jasper: Linguistic evidence**
Before linguistic era --> people is biologically developped
After linguistic era --> people is culturally developped

**Grombich: time and place conciousness**
--> knowing what happen when and where --> 3100 BC Egypt

**David Christian: the very beginning of time**
--> every event since the beginning of the universe affect the event later on in time.
Thus, we cannot understand the later event with understanding the earlier one.
--> universe changes in "treshold" when which is when a "goldilock condition" is met.
