# Week 2
*October 25, 2018*

Start of the class - comparative discussion of sway from three groups.
An **idea**: if we study history using languages and writing, the focus of the study would be race and great nations. We would forget that we all are humans. We would also forget race and nations which are not important to the history. We would also forget groups of people which are not leaders. We forget that there are other things important to the human race than the humans.

### Pablo Picasso, Guernica (1937)

This depicts the Nazi Germany destroying a Spanish Village Guernica. He implies that the Spanish independence(?) comes from the fightings and sacrifice of people.

### David Christian
We all are humans and that nations do not matter. Why do we have to go as far back?

Consider Carl Sagan and Voyager I. The Voyager I's objective to go explore out of the space. Carl Sagan was the project adviser. In 1990, the Voyager I went beyond Uranus. Sagan advised the voyager to redirect the camera to face the Earth.  

If we look far enough away, we will see that the human actions do not matter.

*Note*: Make sure to listen to Christian. 

The two central themes of world environment are (1) how a changing biosphere shaped human history and (2) how the human action has shaped the biosphere.

Some examples: the flute, the red dots panel (implied that the social structure in the old stone age allowed women to create artwork), and the bear skull altar, the bear skull altar (implied religion - the development of the society during that time), bison painting.
