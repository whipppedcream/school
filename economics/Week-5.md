# Week 5

*November 13, 2018*

Read **Most car traded will be lemons** from *Reading-Week-2*

**Adverse Selection**: inequality of information between buyers and sellers

 - Cars: Sellers > Buyers

 - Insurance: Sellers < Buyers

    - eg. if you say you smoke, the insurance premium rises
    - to solve this, same prices are given to all people
    - Moral Hazard: eg. not locking the door when you have a house insurance; when we do not have to take responsibility for the expenses
Then I slept. แล้วพลอยก็จดต่อ
