Read two materials as given in week 1 (What is economics? page 6-9)

### Value vs Utility

Value = literal price. Value of diamond >> value of water in a normal society. Value depends on the market mechanism and the demand and supply. 

Utility has no standard form of determination. Utility is subjective. Take for example diamond vs water in the desert. Note that people who really loves diamond may still prefer diamond to water in the desert. 

### Marginal Utility

The principle is if humans have an access to a resource multiple times, the *apparent* value or the utility is reduced. Total utility is the maximum point of utility. After total utility has been reached, the utility will always decrease. This is called **the law of diminishing returns** (diminishing marginal utility).

For example, more than three teachers may not be as useful. BNK48 handshake events are organized in a three-month interval in order to keep marginal utility high.
