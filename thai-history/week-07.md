**Important Events During 1880s-1890s**

- 2426: death of Somdet Chaophraya
- 2428: death of HRH wichaichan, abolition of front palace
- 2430: establishment of crown prince (to avoid the problem of people fighting for the throne), vajirunhis was the crown prince
- 2431: beginning of the railway project
- 2435: establishment of the privy council and 12 ministries, foreign countries are now trying to define their own colonies and borders. Borders used to not be as important as in the reign of King Rama V. 

**The Case of Phra Preecha**

was a member of Young Siam. He met a woman named Fairy Knox(?) (the daughter of Thomas Knox (กงสุลอังกฤษประจำสยาม) , who supported วังหน้า - พระเจ้า George Washington). His surname was อำมาตยกุล (was a family that have always fought with the บุนนาคs). He was in a relationship with Fairy Knox. Thomas Knox knew this and called for Phra Preecha to take responsibility by marrying Fairy Knox. When he married, he was punished by being โบย'ed. When Thomas Knox knew that he was punished, he was angry and ordered the English fleet to release Phra Preecha. Phra Preecha was also additionally convicted of 27 crimes and was executed. His father was also expelled from the government. 

**Ror Sor 112**

was an event that changed King Rama V's thinking of the government. After that, his son died. He initiated a new project, which was to travel to other countries. During that time, France has conquered Vietnam and England has conquered Burma. 10 years after that, they signed the **Anglo-French Declaration** to declare Siam as a buffer state and agreed not to colonize Siam. 

**The First Visit to Europe**

Before he went to France, he first went to Russia. A song a Russian (Pyotr Schurovsky) authored for Siam was เพลงสรรเสริญพระบารมี. Tsar Nicholas II was invited to Siam, and was greeted very well. This paid off well, impressing the Tsar and gaining Russian respect for the Siam. The Russians wrote about the French making a mistake for being an enemy with Siam. The French should also let Siam retain its sovereignty and stop invading the land. This was the reason he went first to Russia. However, the Tsar could not help Siam with the land. 

**The Change**

Rama V changed by considering five important things, the government, territory (border), economy, and population.

**Siam lost its territory?**

We lost what we have never had. Had the land that we have lost been ours? Siam should negotiate with the French in order to tell them that Thai and Laos have always been one. This can be seen from the name of King Rama V's sons, which can thoroughly describe the power of Siam at that time. The farthest north at that time was อุตรดิตถ์, and the farthest south of สงขลานครินทร์. 

กรมดำรง asked everyone to stop calling (?) as Laos, and called them อุดร พายัพ ฯลฯ. 

The question is what have we lost from the event and what have we gained?
