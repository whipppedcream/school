# Week 9

*December 11, 2018*

After the ror sor 112 event, there were cartoons making fun of Siam, such as the wolf (France) and the lamb (Siam). Rama V also did many things to counter France's actions. Some events include the visit to Europe. In 1897 he visited Europe. The plan was inspired by the foreign advisors of Siam. There were 139 in total.

An important man in this time is **Gustave Rolin-Jaequemyns**. He is รัฐมนตรีกระทรวงมหาดไทย of Belgium. He got introduced to กรมดำรงราชานุภาพ (Rama V's brother) in Egypt. One important thing he did was observing that the foreign minister of Siam (Prince Devawongse) at that time was bad. This led to disadvantages in negotiations with France. This led to the continuous French support of Prince Devawongse. He encouraged King Rama V to change the minister and was one of the first persons to encourage King Rama V to travel to Europe. (Note: He arrived at Bangkok in 1892, five years before the the ror sor 112 event.)

One question arises: why do the French want the left side of the Mekong river? The answer was that the French had explored and found out that the Mekong river led to China (At that time, Cambodia was not explored much.). This would open the immense Chinese market for French industrial goods. 

In 1904, the English and the French signed one of the most important treaties: **Entente Cordiale**. The main content was that the English and the French were allies and would divide lands between one another. In 1904-05 was the Russo-Japanese war. Russia was France's ally, and Japan was England's ally. This helped led to the signing of entente cordiale. There were three main declarations in the entente cordial. 

1. A Declaration respecting Egypt and Morocco
2. A convention respecting Newfoundland and West and Central Africa
3. A Declaration concerning Siam, Madagascar, and the New Hebrides.

The most important was number 3. The land on the left of Chao Phraya river were under English influence, and the land on the right of the Chao Phraya river were under French influence. If we take a look at a google map scatter plot, we will notice that consuls of each corresponding countries were on either sides of the river. 

The treaty also mentioned that the two contracting parties will disclaim all ideas of annexing any Siamese territory, and the two governments shall each have liberty in there spheres of influence. 

So what did we lose and what did we gain? If we take a look at *Siam and Laos, as seen by our American missionaries*, we will see that it is very different from the present-day map, which was written and drawn by James M. McCarthy. If Laos really had been in control of Thailand, why does Rama V has to please Laos?

Are tributaries our territory?
